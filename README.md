# Master-Thesis-Code
In 2024 Femke Klein presented her master thesis ”Compressible vs. incompressible pore water in fully-saturated
poroelastic soil”, which is an extension of the recently published paper by Myron van Damme and Dennis Den Ouden-van der Horst titled ”An alternative process-based approach to predicting the response of water saturated porous media to hydrodynamic loads”. The thesis will be published on the respository of the TU Delft. The code for deriving a numerical solution to Biot's model and a new model using Finite-Element methods and Backward Euler method is in this respository.

- In directory 'code_1d' the codes for computing the numerical results to the one-dimensional model of Biot and the one-dimensional new model of Van Damme and Den
  Ouden-Van der Horst can be found.
- In directory 'code_2d' the codes for computing the numerical results to the two-dimensional model of Biot and the two-dimensional new model of Van Damme and Den
  Ouden-Van der Horst can be found.
- In file 'load_stresses_density' the code is stated for making the transient hydraulic load, normal stress, shear stress and density of the soil more visually.
