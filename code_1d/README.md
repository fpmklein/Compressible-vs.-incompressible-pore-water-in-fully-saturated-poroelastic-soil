# Master-Thesis-Code 1D
In this directory 'code_1d' the codes for computing the numerical results to the one-dimensional model of Biot and the one-dimensional new model of Van Damme and Den Ouden-Van der Horst can be found.

- File 'data1d_paper': the 1D data of (B. Liu, 2015) and (L. Zaat, 2022).
- File 'fem_functions_1d': the basis code for the Finite-Element method in 1D based on the codes for the assignments made for the course Applied Finite Elements
  (D.Toshniwal, 2023).
- File 'parameters_1d': the parameters of the model can be changed here.
- File 'plot_functions_1d': the code to plot the one-dimensional solutions.
- File 'model_1d_1layer': the code for deriving the 1D numerical solution using the 1D data of (B. Liu, 2015). Here one layer of soil is assumed.
  # Run this file for results. 
- File 'model_1d_2layers': the code for deriving the 1D numerical solution using the 1D data of (L. Zaat, 2022). Here two layer of different kind of soils is
  assumed.
