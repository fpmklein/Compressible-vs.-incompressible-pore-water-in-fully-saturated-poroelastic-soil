# Master-Thesis-Code 2D
In this directory 'code_2d' the codes for computing the numerical results to the two-dimensional model of Biot and the two-dimensional new model of Van Damme and Den Ouden-Van der Horst can be found.

- File 'fem_functions_2d': the basis code for the Finite-Element method in 2D based on the codes for the assignments made for the course Applied Finite Elements
  (D.Toshniwal, 2023).
- File 'parameters_2d': the parameters of the two-dimensional model can be changed here.
- File 'plot_functions_2d': the code to plot the two-dimensional solutions.
- File 'model_2d_1layer': the code for deriving the 2D numerical solution. Here one layer of soil is assumed.
